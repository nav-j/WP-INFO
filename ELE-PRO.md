## **Using Shortcodes Inside Elementor**

### **Method 1: Use the “Shortcode” Widget**

1. Open your custom page in **Elementor**.
2. In the left panel, search for **“Shortcode”**.
3. Drag the **Shortcode widget** to where you want products to appear.
4. Paste your WooCommerce shortcode — for example:

   ```plaintext
   [products category="tshirts" limit="6" columns="3"]
   ```
5. Click **Update** and preview your page.
   → Your WooCommerce products will display instantly.

### **Method 2: Use Inside Text Editor Widget**

If you already have a text block:

1. Add a **Text Editor** widget.
2. Paste the shortcode directly into the text box:

   ```plaintext
   [featured_products per_page="4" columns="2"]
   ```
3. Elementor will render it on the live page after you update.

## **Tip**

Even though Elementor has its own **“Products” widgets** (in **Elementor Pro**), shortcodes are:

* Great for **quick product displays**
* Work with **any version** (free or pro)
* Don’t slow down your page

✅ **In short:**

> You can freely mix **Elementor layouts** with **WooCommerce shortcodes** — they are fully compatible.
